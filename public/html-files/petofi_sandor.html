            <p class="text-lg">Through his poem "Nemzeti dal" (<span class="hungarian">National Song</span>), which he recited on March 15, 1848, Petőfi ignited the revolutionary spirit that would define Hungary's struggle for independence.

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Early Life</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Sándor Petőfi was born as Sándor Petrovics on January 1, 1823, in Kiskőrös, Hungary, to a family of Slovakian ancestry. Despite his ethnic origins, Petőfi always strongly identified as Hungarian. His father, István Petrovics, was a butcher and innkeeper, while his mother, Mária Hrúz, was a domestic servant.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-6">Education and Wandering Years</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Petőfi attended eight different schools throughout his youth, showing early signs of an independent and restless spirit. At 18, he abandoned his formal education to join the National Theatre in Pest as an assistant, occasionally appearing in minor roles. This began a period of wandering and uncertainty, as he joined traveling theater troupes, briefly served in the army between 1839 and 1841, and struggled with financial instability.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-6">Rise to Literary Fame</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">His literary career began in 1842 when his first poem was published in the journal <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>. In 1844, with the support of the renowned poet Mihály Vörösmarty, Petőfi published his first collection of poetry. The simple, authentic style of his poems, which drew on Hungarian folk traditions, quickly captivated readers and established him as one of Hungary's most popular poets.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-6">Personal Life</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">In 1847, Petőfi married Júlia Szendrey, who became his muse and inspired many of his most beautiful love poems. Their son, Zoltán, was born in December 1848. His marriage to Júlia marked a pivotal period in his life and work, enriching his poetry with deeper themes of love and devotion.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-6">Final Days</h3>
                    <p>Petőfi disappeared during the Battle of Segesvár (today Sighișoara, Romania) on July 31, 1849, while serving as an aide-de-camp to General Józef Bem in the Hungarian Revolutionary Army. His body was never found, leading to numerous legends about his fate. This mysterious disappearance has only enhanced his legendary status in Hungarian culture.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Role in the 1848 Revolution</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">As political tensions grew across Europe in the 1840s, Petőfi became increasingly involved in revolutionary circles. By 1847, he was deeply studying the history of the 1789 French Revolution and developing strong republican views that were reflected in his increasingly political poetry.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-6">On March 15, 1848—a date now celebrated as a Hungarian national holiday—Petőfi played a pivotal role in igniting the Hungarian Revolution. That morning, he recited his newly-written poem "Nemzeti dal" (National Song) at the Pilvax Café in Pest, then again at the University of Medicine, electrifying crowds with its call to action against Habsburg rule.</p>
                    
                    <div class="quote mb-6 px-4">
                        <p>"Hungarians, get on your feet! This is the time, this is the need! Shall we be free or remain slaves? The answer is: No two ways!"</p>
                        <p class="text-right">— from "Nemzeti dal" (National Song)</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Together with other young intellectuals known as the "March Youth" (Márciusi Ifjak), Petőfi proclaimed the famous "12 Points," a list of demands for greater Hungarian autonomy within the Habsburg Empire. They succeeded in having their revolutionary documents published without censorship, marking the first free press products in Hungary.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-6">Military Service</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">As the revolution progressed, Petőfi became increasingly radical. He joined the revolutionary army, eventually becoming aide-de-camp to Polish General Józef Bem, who commanded the Transylvanian army fighting against Habsburg and Russian forces.</p>
                    
                    <p>Petőfi's republican views and his call for the complete overthrow of Habsburg rule eventually made him controversial even among more moderate revolutionaries. Nonetheless, he remained steadfast in his principles, eventually sacrificing his life for Hungary's independence. He disappeared during the Battle of Segesvár on July 31, 1849, where the Hungarian forces were defeated by the Russian imperial army that had intervened to help the Habsburgs crush the revolution.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Petőfi revolutionized Hungarian poetry through his simple, direct style that drew heavily on folk traditions and the vernacular language. Breaking away from the ornate, formal poetry that dominated Hungarian literature, he wrote accessibly for the common people. His works span from love poems and pastoral idylls to fiery political verse.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">During his short lifetime, Petőfi wrote nearly 1,000 poems, of which about 850 have survived. His poetic innovations included pioneering family poetry, depicting spousal love, and creating a new form of landscape poetry that celebrated the Hungarian countryside, particularly the Great Hungarian Plain (Az Alföld).</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">János Vitéz (John the Valiant)</h3>

                        <p class="mb-4">One of Petőfi's most celebrated works is his epic poem "János Vitéz" (John the Valiant), published in 1845. This narrative poem tells the story of János, a simple shepherd who, after losing his beloved Iluska, embarks on a series of fantastic adventures.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">The poem follows János as he joins a band of hussars, battles with Turks, navigates through lands of giants and witches, and eventually reaches the Kingdom of Fairies. In this fairy realm, he discovers that his beloved Iluska has been transformed into a rose. When he sprinkles her with the Water of Life, she is restored to human form, and the couple live happily as the king and queen of Fairyland.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">Written in 370 four-line stanzas, "János Vitéz" combines elements of Hungarian folk tales with heroic adventures and romantic love. It has become a cornerstone of Hungarian culture, adapted into operas, plays, films, and animated features. The work perfectly exemplifies Petőfi's ability to elevate folk-inspired material to the level of high art while maintaining accessibility for all Hungarians.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Cultural Impact</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">Petőfi's impact on Hungarian culture and national identity cannot be overstated. He revolutionized Hungarian literature by creating a new poetic language that drew on folk traditions while addressing contemporary concerns. His works helped establish Hungarian as a literary language of European significance.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">In Hungary, the name "Petőfi" has become synonymous with poetry itself. His face and verses are known to virtually every Hungarian schoolchild, and he remains the most widely read poet in the country. March 15, the day of his revolutionary recitation, is now celebrated as a national holiday in Hungary.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">National Symbol</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Petőfi's mysterious disappearance on the battlefield enhanced his legendary status. Unable to find his body, Hungarians created numerous myths about his possible survival or heroic death. This mythologizing transformed him into a potent symbol of Hungarian national aspirations and the desire for freedom and independence.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">Throughout Hungary's turbulent history—from Habsburg rule through Soviet domination—Petőfi's works and image have been invoked by those struggling for Hungarian sovereignty and democratic values. During the 1956 uprising against Soviet control, revolutionaries again recited his "Nemzeti dal" in an echo of 1848.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">International Recognition</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Beyond Hungary, Petőfi's work has been translated into over 50 languages. His poetry has influenced writers across Central and Eastern Europe and beyond. The directness, passion, and democratic spirit of his verse resonate with readers worldwide.</p>
                
                <p>In 2023, Hungary celebrated the bicentenary of Petőfi's birth with numerous exhibitions, performances, and publications, demonstrating the enduring power of his legacy two centuries after his birth.</p>
